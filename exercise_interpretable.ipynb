        "# Interpretable Modelling of Credit Risk\n",
        "\n",
        "As detailed in Cynthia Rudin's excellent commentary on interpretability [(ArXiV version here)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10154), there are a plethora of reasons to avoid the use of black box models when models are being used to make high stakes decisions to may have life-altering effects on real people. Efforts to develop \"explainable black box models,\" while appealing for their potential to let us continuing using the same tools we always have and to creation explanations after the fact, are inherently flawed. As Rudin notes in my single favorite passage from her paper:\n",
        "\n",
        "> Explainable ML methods provide explanations that are not faithful to what the original model computes. Explanations must be wrong. They cannot have perfect fidelity with respect to the original model. If the explanation was completely faithful to what the original model computes, the explanation would equal the original model, and one would not need the original model in the first place, only the explanation. (In other words, this is a case where the original model would be interpretable.) This leads to the danger that any explanation method for a black box model can be an inaccurate representation of the original model in parts of the feature space.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> An inaccurate (low-fidelity) explanation model limits trust in the explanation, and by extension, trust in the black box that it is trying to explain. An explainable model that has a 90% agreement with the original model indeed explains the original model most of the time. However, an explanation model that is correct 90% of the time is wrong 10% of the time. If a tenth of the explanations are incorrect, one cannot trust the explanations, and thus one cannot trust the original black box. If we cannot know for certain whether our explanation is correct, we cannot know whether to trust either the explanation or the original model.\n",
        "\n",
        "With this motivation in mind, in this exercise, we will use a cutting edge interpretable modeling framework to model credit risk using data from the [14th Pacific-Asia Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining conference (PAKDD 2010)](https://pakdd.org/archive/pakdd2010/). This data covers the period of 2006 to 2009, and \"comes from a private label credit card operation of a Brazilian credit company and its partner shops.\" (The competition was won by [TIMi](https://timi.eu/blog/news/timi-top-winner-at-the-pakdd-2010-cup/), who purely by coincidence helped me complete my PhD dissertation research!).\n",
        "\n",
        "We will be working with Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) (not to be confused with Generalized *Linear* Models (GLMs) — GLMs are a special case of GAMs). In particular, we will be using the [pyGAM](https://pygam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/tour_of_pygam.html), though this is far from the only GAM implementation out there. [mvgam](https://nicholasjclark.github.io/mvgam/) in R is probably considered the gold standard, as it was developed by a pioneering researcher of GAMs. `statsmodels` also has [an implementation](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/gam.html), and GAM is also hiding in plain sight behind many other tools, like Meta's [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) time series forecasting library (which is GAM-based)."

You can learn more [about it here](https://interpret.ml/docs/ebm.html), though how much sense it will make to you may be limited if you aren't familiar with gradient boosting yet. Still, at least one of your classmates prefers it to pyGAM, so give it a try using this code:\n",
