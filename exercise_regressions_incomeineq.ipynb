    "# Estimating Gender Discrimination in the Workplace\n",

    "In this exercise we'll use data from the 2018 US Current Population Survey (CPS) to try and estimate the effect of being a woman on workplace compensation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that our focus will be *only* on differential compensation in the work place, and as a result it is important to bear in mind that our estimates are not estimates of *all* forms of gender discrimination. For example, these analyses will not account for things like gender discrimination in terms of *getting* jobs. We'll discuss this in more detail below."

The file is called `morg18.dta` and is a Stata dataset. Additional data on the dataset can be found by following the links in the README.txt file in the folder, but for the moment it is sufficient to know this is a national survey run in the United States.\n",

    "The survey does include some survey weights we won't be using (i.e. not everyone in the sample was included with the same probability), so the numbers we estimate will not be perfect estimates of the gender wage gap in the United States, but they are pretty close."

    "Fixed effects are a method used when we have a nested data structure in which respondents belong to groups, and those groups may all be subject to different pressures. In this context, for example, we can add fixed effects for the industry of each respondent—since wages often vary across industries, controlling for industry is likely to improve our estimates. Use `ind02` to control for industry.\n",

    "When we add fixed effects for groups like this, our interpretation of the other coefficients changes. Whereas in previous exercises we were trying to explain variation in men and women's wages *across all respondents*, we are now effectively comparing men and women's wages *within each employment sector*. Our coefficient on `female`, in other words, now tells us how much less (on average) we would expect a woman to be paid than a man *within the same industry*, not across all respondents. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that running this regression will result in lots of coefficients popping up you don't care about. We'll introduce some more efficient methods for adding fixed effects that aren't so messy in a later class -- for now, you can ignore those coefficients!)"
